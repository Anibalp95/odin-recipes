        <p>Best way to eat potatoes.</p>
        <p>Haven't met a single person that dislikes them.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large russet potato</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pat with papel towels until thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the
                hot
                oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until
                golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
        </ol>
